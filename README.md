## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a rhythm-based game inspired by OSU! gameplay mechanics. The project is built using Unity and focuses on delivering an engaging experience with autogenerated beatmaps, dynamic visuals, and precise timing-based gameplay. Players interact with notes and enemies in sync with the music, aiming for high scores and accuracy.

## Features
- **Core Gameplay**: Timing-based note hitting mechanics with visual feedback for hits and misses.
- **Beatmap System**: Supports custom beatmaps generated via Python scripts and integrated into the game.
- **Auto-Play Mode**: Allows players to watch the game play itself for demonstration or calibration purposes.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Includes approach rings, hit circles, and notification texts for feedback. 
- **Song Selection Menu**: UI that automatically expands based on current beatmaps for selecting songs and difficulties.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Tracks player performance, including scores, accuracy, combo, and hit/miss counts.
- **Save System**: Stores high scores and personal bests for each song and difficulty.
- **Calibration Mode**: Allows players to adjust audio offset for precise timing.
- **Taiko Visual Assist**: A separate Bar that shrinks the dimension to a straight line, for clearer visual if needed.

## Project Structure
### Key Components
- **Gameplay**:  
  - `OSUBeatNote.cs`: Handles individual notes, their animations, and hit/miss processing.
  - `RhythmManagerOSUAimless.cs`: Manages the overall game state, note spawning, and interactions.
- **UI**:  
  - `SongRowController.cs`: Manages song selection and difficulty toggles.
  - `SongFinishedMenu.cs`: Displays statistics and options after a song finishes.
- **Beatmap Generation**:  
  - `GenerateBeatmapWindow.cs`: Editor tool for generating beatmaps using Python scripts.
- **Save System**:  
  - `SongRecord.cs`: Stores player performance data for each song and difficulty.

### External Tools
- **Python Integration**: A Python script (`generate_beatmap.py`) is used to generate beatmaps from audio files. The script processes audio and outputs JSON files that are imported into Unity.

### Assets
- **Visuals**: Simple Visuals using basic UI elements but with Layered Logic.
- **Audio**: Supports automatic generation of custom music tracks for beatmaps.

## Requirements
- **Unity Version**: 6000.0.54f1 (or later).
- **.NET Framework**: 4.7.1.
- **Python**: Required for beatmap generation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Unity (version 6000.0.54f1 or later).
3. Ensure Python is installed and accessible via the command line. Ensure Librosa Library is installed.
4. Run the game or use the `GenerateBeatmapWindow` tool to create custom beatmaps.

## Usage
### Playing the Game
1. Select a song and difficulty from the jukebox menu.
2. Hit notes in sync with the music to score points.
3. View your performance statistics after the song ends.

### Beatmap Generation
1. Open the `GenerateBeatmapWindow` tool in Unity Editor (`Tools > Beatmap > Auto-Generate`).
2. Select an audio file and difficulty level.
3. Generate the beatmap and import it into the project.

### Calibration
Use the calibration mode to adjust audio offset for precise timing:
- Increase or decrease the offset using the provided UI controls.
